# SearchableDesign Overview

#Used Technology:
1. ASP.NET CORE MVC: i used core because as it Support multiple platforms as it provides the option to build apps on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is open-source framework that is mainly used for web based software application. Because of its features such as Asynchronous programming, Memory management, Cross-platform architecture, High performance etc.

2. For database I used MSSQL(Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio) for maintaining relational data.

3. For front-end technology i prefered Vue js framework. Because it is lightWeight, DOM manipulation benefit, Speed and performance & easy to used over other framework .

#Software Architectural Design:
  I used clean software architecture design approach where the whole appllication is divided into multiple layer(UI, Business logic layer, Data access layer and Domain layer). It makes code clean and understandable. This architecture allows us to change the external system without affecting the core of the system. In a highly testable environment, we can test our code quickly and easily. We can create a highly scalable and quality product.
